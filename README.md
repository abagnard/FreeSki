# FreeSki
https://abagnard.github.io/SkiFree/

### Background
This is a remake on the infamous 1990s computer game SkiFree -- without the Abominable Snow Monster (as of now...).

The goal of this version is to lead the skier down the hill without hitting a tree or a rock. If you can make ski without falling for 60 seconds, you win! If you fall three times, you lose.

### Instructions
Control the skier using the left, right and down arrow keys. Click the buttons on the right to pause and start a new game.

Remaining lives and the time elapsed is kept track on the top right of the screen.


### Functionality & MVP
With this version of the game, users will be able to:
1.	Pause and reset the game
2.	Change the direction of skiers movement using the arrow keys
3.	Keeps count of number of lives left

In addition, this project will include:
1.	A directions model (shows at start of game and on pause)
2.	A game over model

Wireframes:
This app will consist of a single screen with game board and nav links to pause and restart the game and links to my GitHub and my LinkedIn. Trees and rocks will be scattered on the game bored with the skier located in the middle of the screen.
